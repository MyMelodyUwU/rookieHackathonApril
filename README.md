#About

Inspiration
We all procrastinate on the computer and never get things done. ProcrastinateMe will change things up by allocating time for work and breaks, helping you focus on your tasks.

What it does
Locks your screen for you, with a break timer, on top of that, there is lo-fi music and live ducks with background tasks being done, so you are rest assured that everything will be done.

How we built it
The program was written using visual c# in Visual Studio 2019.

Challenges we ran into
Organising our Github repo and branches was one of the main problems we ran into as our final program would have to be pushed onto one branch and we didn't want conflicting files.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Not giving up.

What we learned
Idea means everything! We were very close to withdrawing the project, but we never gave up.

What's next for dogepwn
Having a live stream and satisfying lofi music to go with the application.
